After two weeks of deteriorating health our hamster Penny finally passed away this morning.  Two years ago I brought her home from the Park Slope Petland Discounts, holding the handlebars of my bike in one hand and her cardboard box in the other.  Her distinctive black/brown and white coloring caught my eye in the store, and her name was inspired by the penguin-like appearance.

What separated Penny from the other hamsters I've owned was that she was keenly aware of her surroundings.  She knew when you were talking to her and when you were outside her cage.  She woke up every morning while I was putting on my deodorant, peeking her little head out from under her paper towel sheets.

Christine and I always referred to her as our third roommate, and would always admonish her for not chipping in to the rent or doing her share of the chores.  We would greet her every time we came home from work, and say goodnight to her every night before bed.  She was a part of our household and she will be missed.
