After finishing the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114964?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=erikol03-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0143114964"><em>In Defense of Food</em></a> a couple of months ago I resolved to start eating more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">food</span> and less "food", aka food products and food science.  A sandwich using fresh meat and bread is certainly more appealing then a Lean Pocket, but not everything in my fridge is easily to swap out for its more natural counterpart.  After watching a <a href="http://vimeo.com/4941611">video on the history of butter vs. margarine</a> I knew it was time to switch, but I had a dark past with butter that I didn't want to relive...
<blockquote>I take my morning bagel out of the toaster oven, perfectly crisped on the outside while remaining soft and chewy in the middle.  I cut a pat of butter off and place it upon the bagel with my knife.  I try to spread it across the bagel's warm surface,  but instead of spreading it sinks further into the bread.  The more I try to spread it the further it sinks, until eventually I relent.  Since the butter pat is so thick it never fully melts, and the other half of the bagel is barren and dry.  Butter has ruined another breakfast.</blockquote>
It was for this reason that I switched to margarine long ago, and why I was unwilling to switch back.  That is until I came across Land O Lakes Spreadable Butter.  I was cautiously optimistic when I took it home from the grocery store, because I've been burned in the past with whipped butter which didn't come close to the spreadability of margarine.  To my delight however it was super easy to spread and had a really great butter taste.  Plus the ingredients were dead simple compared to margarine:

I've been buying the spreadable butter ever since, and I haven't looked back.  If you value the integrity of your bagel I urge you to join me in smooth, buttery bliss.
